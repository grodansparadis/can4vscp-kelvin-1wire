**Standard column** list values recommended in Dallas/Maxim standard document. 

**Default column** is defaults used on this module and are values that empirically has been found to work better with longer cable lengths.

Writing the two **16-bit values** takes affect in the system when the LSB byte is written. So the writing order is, first write the MSB and then then the LSB.
